Pub/Sub is an asynchronous global messaging service. By decoupling senders and receivers, it allows for secure and highly available communication between independently written applications. 
Pub/Sub delivers low-latency, durable messaging.

In Pub/Sub, publisher applications and subscriber applications connect with one another through the use of a shared string called a topic. A publisher application creates and sends messages to a topic. Subscriber applications create a subscription to a topic to receive messages from it.
